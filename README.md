# Torrentbox

A docker file for making a NordVPN transmission torrent box.

This is a really simple application to start; simply add a .openvpn_credentials to the root directory in the format:

```plaintext
username
password
```
From your NordVPN service credentials and run compose up.

Form there you may want to pick what server you connect to, to which I refer you to https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/20164827795345-Connect-to-NordVPN-using-Linux-Terminal
